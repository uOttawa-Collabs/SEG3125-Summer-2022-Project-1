## Previous Experience and Learning Resources

I do have some experience on JavaScript, but I don't have much frontend development experience before. UI design is
almost a start-from-scratch thing for me.

For tutorial material, I was mainly reading about official documentations. For example, Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)
docs are a quality source as a frontend development reference, which contains the numerous entries and examples of the
latest standard of HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Official site themselves, like Bootstrap and jQuery, serves as a good reference
for corresponding frameworks.

When I encounter a problem, I usually go to Stack Overflow, which has most of the answers to my confusion, or I would
Google the problem and find the wanted answer.

## Business Service Type

I chose the website to be an online cat cafe booking portal.
It mostly provides entertainment services for the public domain.

## Inspiration Sites

* [Uber Eats](https://www.ubereats.com/)
* [Feline Cafe Ottawa](https://felinecafeottawa.com/)
* [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.ca/)

## Original Mockups

## Modifications and Improvements

I kept most of the UI design in the mockup. There are a few elements that were changed:

* The buttons are all designed with rounded corners for better visual effect.
* There are feedbacks that pointed out that the layout for the lists are too compact, i.e., the lists on the "Visit a
  Lounge" and "Meet our Stars!" pages, so I added white space between them.
* Some comments also pointed out that the left region (with large portion of white spaceï¼‰and lists are not balanced.
  The left part seems too empty and the right part (contains lists) has too much information. I adjusted the occupation
  ratio between the two parts and relieved the sense of unbalanced layout.
* I moved out the booking dialog as a separate page, as the background of the previous design would have too much
  information.
* For the index page, I changed the image to be the background image, rather than on the right side, and I added a light
  opaque filter for the navigation bar, in order to enhance readability,

## Adopted Goal from Peers

1. Goal: Account based service for regulars
    * There are sign-in and sign-up buttons that are native for accounts. But since this is a serverless frontend page,
      I am not able to realize the functionality of account management.
2. Goal: Content management for lounge owners
    * The content management functionality can be solved by extending the account domain: not only the user would have
      an account, but also the lounge owners will have their accounts, which can be used for managing online contents.

## Comments

1. I particularly designed and reviewed all the font colors and sizes for **readability**. All the texts are of adequate
   contrast with the background and large enough, so they can be easily read.
2. The core design principle is **simplicity**. For each page, I only preserve minimum number of visual elements,
   without losing aesthetic requirement. Thus, the pages would provide user a relaxed and pleasant reading experience.
3. The progress bar with step indicator is employed in the booking page. I believe the progress bar will well-fit into
   the booking process, which is completely linear.
4. Various optimization for user experience is carried out. For example. when a user books a lounge and goes back and
   forth between the steps, the pages respond swiftly and previous filled information won't lose. Before the order is
   completed,
   the page will prompt a message to get confirmation from the user before the user leaves, which will largely prevent
   accident closure of the page and input data loss.
